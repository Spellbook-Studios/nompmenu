# No Multiplayer Menu
This mod makes it impossible to open the multiplayer screen, and whenever the client tries to open the screen, the main title screen is opened instead.

## Use case
* When you don't want player to be able to access the multiplayer screen
* When you want people to be sent to the main menu after leaving a server
    * e.g. <https://modrinth.com/modpack/wynncraft-ultimate>

### Using this
You are allowed to use this in any personal modpack,
but this mod may only be distributed in modpacks published on Modrinth and Curseforge
